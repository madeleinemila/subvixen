    <h3 class="about">When would I use Subvixen?</h3>
    <p class="plain-text">Subvixen was designed for pixel-mapping applications, the most obvious of which is programming collections of LEDs.</p>
    <p class="plain-text">Some reasons you might find yourself wanting to use pixel-mapping:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="plain-text">Your effect is visually or mathematically intricate.</li>
      <li class="sub-point">You might want an effect that is very complex, random or hard to code... but easy to represent (or already exists) as a video.</li>
      <li class="plain-text">Your effect is spatially aware.</li>
      <li class="sub-point">You might want to achieve effects like chases that respond correctly to the real-world spacing of your LEDs, but it could be complex or inflexible to write your code taking into account irregular spacing.</li>
      <li class="plain-text">You don't think in code.</li>
      <li class="sub-point">It might be quicker for you to make a video than it is to write code.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3 class="about">What are the limitations of Subvixen?</h3>
    <p class="plain-text">Subvixen is currently generating code for Neopixel LEDs and the Arduino IDE. However, the lookup table generated within the code could easily be pulled out and used in other implementations.</p>
